**How RAG Enhances LLMs**

**Retrieve Information:** RAG improves a language model's performance by retrieving relevant documents based on a user’s query.
**Augment Context:** It combines the retrieved documents with the original user query, providing more context to the model.
**Generate Response:** The model uses this enriched context to generate a more accurate and relevant response.

**Basic Steps in RAG**

**Input:** The user’s question is the starting point.
**Indexing:** Documents are indexed into a database by breaking them into chunks and creating vector embeddings.
**Retrieval:** The system finds relevant documents by comparing the query to the indexed vectors.
**Generation:** The system combines the retrieved documents with the original query and sends this combined input to the model to generate a response.

**Building a RAG Chatbot**

Prepare Your Knowledge Base: Use a PDF or similar document as the source of knowledge.

**Create Required Files:**

**requirements.txt:** Lists necessary libraries.
**app.py: **The script for your chatbot.
**Set Up on Hugging Face:** Create an account on Hugging Face to manage and use the models.

**Tools Used**

**Zephyr LLM:** Your language model.
**all-MiniLM-L6-v2:** A fast and effective model for mapping sentences to vectors.

This setup will enable your chatbot to access and use up-to-date, relevant information to answer user queries more effectively.
